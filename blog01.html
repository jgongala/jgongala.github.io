                <p>
                  Since I am going to focus on importance of online presence, you might ask what exactly it is, and what do we understand by online presence. 
                  Nowadays more and more people when they look for product or they look for services, the common place that they look for it is on the Internet. 
                  So, it is very important that each and every single company has some form of presence withing the Internet. Marketing company, TrustWokz, 
                  defines online presence as a living and breathing essence of your business on the web.  
                  The second thing to consider when talking about online presence is that weather you have a website or your social media, 
                  there is some form of information that is being written out there about you, your company, or about anything that you do so you always need to choose whether 
                  you want to be reactive or do you want to be proactive in the sense, do you want to tell your own story, introduce yourself, your brand or product. 
                  This is the basic reason why you should get involved and work on your online presence.  
                  Build and manage online presence so the world will find a vibrant and healthy presence when they bump into you online.

              <div class="post">
                <p>First step in building your own brand is to create a website. This website is like having a profile that is continually sitting on the Internet 
                  that tells people who you are, what you do, and it enables you to tell your own story about where you, or your company started off, what is the 
                  product that you are offering. Owning website that is also your portfolio, will allow you to make your name more searchable online. 
                  Start from getting domain on your name and hosting your page. Below I will add few links for best hosting services in uk:

                    Once you get your domain and hosting services, you can upload your website. 
                    You have to bear in mind that no one expects perfect and brilliant website, as you are just starting you career, 
                    you do not have to commit permanently to a particular design, but you have to make sure that your project meets the basic requirements:

                    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/home/?originalSubdomain=uk">Linkedin</a>
                    <p>
                      Platform that was launched in 2003 and currently they are millions of users worldwide. 
                      Therefore, you need to work on your profile to stand out and the reason to do that is to get better and higher job opportunities. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Recruiters are using LinkedIn to look for candidates and they are looking at thousands of candidates every single day therefore they spent really little time on everybody’s 
                      profile and the very first thing that they are looking at is a picture. You need to have professional picture. 
                      The next important factor on LinkedIn is headline. A lot of people are looking at headlines. Headline is usually defaulted to your current job but there are 120 
                      characters that you should definitely take advantage of so first the first thing that include in your headline should be your job description, 
                      the company you are working for and also something that describes you, your speciality. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Another part of creating good profile, is summary. People usually focus on first four lines, so make sure you have the most important information in there. 
                      Also make sure that you will include your contact information. In summary you have the opportunity to upload something or provide a link, so as a web developer, 
                      make sure you add a link to your portfolio website or GitHub, so people will be able to see your work examples or your projects.

                    <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter </a>
                    <p>
                      You might think why I would suggest you use Twitter. So, Twitter has been around for a long time and is very active platform. 
                      It offers you big engagement from your audience that you could share information about your new projects, or what is happening currently in your life, 
                      what you are working on.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>
                    <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>
                    <p>
                      GitHub is really crucial part of getting hired as a self-taught programmer. Your repository on GitHub will allow the interviewer to do a lot more 
                      in-depth research on you and your work. They could check your code, projects, but also how much have you been doing, how active and commit you are in your work. 
                      Your repository will represent you, and it will show what you have been practicing and how ambitious you are. On GitHub you will show your interest in different 
                      programming languages, and it could be an extra point for you, if you are practicing new frameworks after hours. 
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>
                    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow </a>
                    <p>
                      StackOverflow is a good platform to learn and help others. 
                      It is always good to show your future employer that you are not scared to ask for help or you are happy to help others.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p>
                  If you still do not own accounts on these websites, create profile and make it look professional and skilful. Using social media will let you to present your skills and be active on the Internet.
