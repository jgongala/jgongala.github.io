              <br>
              <div class="post">
                <p>
                  At the beginning, it is worth understanding who a freelancer is and what type of employee he represents, what professions or tasks he performs, and what are the consequences of switching to freelance mode at work.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  Freelancing is a form of self-employment. It is where you offer services for a fee. The unique thing about freelancing that it gives you control over when you work and who you work for. Since you do not work exclusively for any specific company you have the freedom to live anywhere with a reliable internet connection. As a freelancer your main objective is to deliver high quality services on time.

              <h2 class="h3">Advantages and disadvantages of being a freelancer </h2>
              <br>
              <div class="post">
                <p>You should always remember that a freelancer is not a profession in itself, but only a mode of work. And like any mode, it has both advantages and disadvantages. This does not mean, however, that they will be the same for everyone. Much of a freelance career depends on the type of profession they do, their skills, experience, conditions, and resources, as well as circumstances beyond the control of the individual (e.g., legal).
                  <br>
                  Overall, the most frequently mentioned advantages of freelance work are:
                </p>
                <br>
                
                <ul class="list">
                  <li> 
                    Any workplace, the ability to work from home
                  </li>
                  <li> 
                    Flexible schedule and the ability to combine work and pleasure
                  </li>
                  <li> 
                    Independent decisions about the type of work performed

                  <li> 
                    Freedom in the selection of projects and time devoted to them                  
                  </li>
                  <li> 
                    Possibility of self-realization and development in the field that interests us
                  </li>
                  <li> 
                    Often high wages compared to a full-time job
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>
                  Overall, the most frequently mentioned disadvantages of freelance work are:                
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul class="list">
                  <li> 
                    Self-discipline is needed in scheduling and selecting projects
                  </li>
                  <li> 
                    Inconsistent earnings depending on orders

                  <li>

                  <li> 
                    You have to take care of the benefits yourself (such as health insurance, etc.)

                  <li> 
                    Often a very lonely mode of work
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>As mentioned before, the work of a freelancer can be very different, and the advantages and disadvantages mentioned above may have a greater or lesser impact on the real situation in specific cases. The most important thing is to carefully consider the pros and cons of such a system before deciding to switch to freelance mode and act in accordance with the results of such analysis.</p>

                    Currently, freelance work in the IT industry is very popular. In order to gain the right skills to become a front-end developer, you can decide to study independently (thanks to the Internet, almost everyone has access to numerous materials and tutorials that make this task easier) - but this path can be quite discouraging for some, so most people decide for specialized courses, thanks to which they can check and evaluate their skills on an ongoing basis.

              <br>
              <div class="post">
                <p>If you decided to click on this article, it means that you are interested in a specific category of freelance work - as a front-end developer. Therefore, this part of the article will provide some useful tips and steps to help you get started and become a successful freelance front-end developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Regardless of whether you have previous experience in the work of a front-end developer or you just want to start your adventure with this profession, becoming a freelancer involves a whole set of issues that must be solved before your career begins. Generally, a freelance career is slow to develop, and it is worth following the steps below to be successful.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2">Ask yourself the question: what does freelance work mean to you? </h2>
                <p>
                  This is where the idea for freelance usually begins. There is no point in even considering this mode of work if we are not interested in it at all and we do not see anything in it that could give us more benefits than a full-time job.
                </p>
                <p>
                  People who consider freelance work most often have a business idea and a reason why they want to develop their careers in this direction. For some, such a reason may be the independence that comes with being a freelancer. Such people may want to reconcile earning, for example, with traveling around the world, and in such a situation, the possibility of remote work will certainly be useful. Others want to develop their talents and dream of artistic success.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2">Do a decent industry research </h2>
                <p>
                  Nothing good comes from hasty decisions, much less a freelance career. Therefore, before you start looking for a job, read a little about your industry. Check in which sectors and what skills are currently in greatest demand and which companies or clients most often use the services you can offer.               
                 </p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2">Find out about the legal status of the freelancer </h2>
                <p>
                  Unfortunately, we live in a country with numerous and complicated laws. Therefore, before making any decision, it is worthwhile to carefully read the legal situation in which you will find yourself as a freelancer. The best ways to do this are, for example, by consulting an attorney and learning about the experiences of other freelancers (for example, by reading about them on the internet or by asking friends.                
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2">Set goals </h2>
                <p>
                  As a freelancer, you no longer have a boss over you telling you what to do. Therefore, self-discipline is very important, and it is best to have a clear goal in this. This goal can be simply additional earnings, but it can also be a specific success in your industry or even the opportunity to work in a top company after properly expanding your portfolio through freelance work. In addition, you should set yourself smaller time goals, for example, set a specific amount that you would like to earn in a given month.
             </p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2">Start looking for contracts </h2>
                <p>
                  As a front-end developer, there will be no shortage of work, but it is important where you are looking for it. Job advertisements are the obvious choice. In addition to regular full-time job offers, sometimes there are jobs for independent employees on portals. Just enter phrases such as "IT" or "front-end" in the search engine.
               </p>
               <p>
                In the case of a front-end developer, another option is to apply directly to companies. All you need to do is find a company with an IT-related profile and send them your CV and portfolio. This method requires more initiative from the freelancer, but if your skills are positively assessed, you have a chance to get jobs.
               </p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2">Register on the freelancer platform </h2>
                <p>
                  Another option is an online platform designed specifically for freelancers who are looking for jobs. Registering there is simple and allows you to access a wide selection of job offers directed directly to freelancers, without having to consider hundreds of unrelated advertisements.                
                </p>

                <h2 class="h2">Develop Your Portfolio </h2>
                <p>
                  In the confusion of gradual career development and dealing with the daily challenges posed by working as a freelancer, do not forget to expand your portfolio for potential future assignments.             
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2">Adjust your prices to the quality of services and keep it updated: </h2>
                <p>
                  Over time, the quality of your work will increase. As your own employer, you must ensure that your earnings are adjusted to the skills and experience you have. Sometimes this will mean higher prices for your services, but don't worry, those who care about high quality will not hesitate to pay the right amount. It would certainly be more harmful to lower your requirements, not only because of personal loss, but also because it would detract from the hard work of other freelancers in the industry.                </p>
