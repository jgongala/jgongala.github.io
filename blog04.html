                    Did you know that 70% of jobs are found through personal relationships? Your brain and skills will only take you so far to succeed in this world. Networking is a buzzword that many of us have a serious love-hate relationship with, but you really need a network connection who can help you achieve your goals. In fact, they say that you are the average of the five people you spend most of your time with. Luckily it only takes the first 90 seconds or less to get them to open up to you like you and form a connection. So, what exactly is networking. Networking is all about building relationships to develop professional and social contacts and exchange information. Your network consists of family, friends, co-workers, classmates, lectures, and previous employers. Basically, it is what and who you know that will help you get that new career. So get out and create your network and next time you find yourself in the typically awkward networking situation focus on congruence people, notice your body language, make eyes contact and facial expression they all have to sync up so that you come across as authentic and trustworthy.

              <h2 class="h3">How to network like a PRO on networking events: </h2>
              <br>
              <div class="post">
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2">Have a clear goal in mind.</h2>
                <p>
                  Next time you are going to an event, ask yourself who do you want to meet and why. If the guest list is available, take a moment to scan it. See a person or the company on the list you’ve been hoping to connect with. Look at the guest’s LinkedIn profile to learn a little bit more about them so you could seek them out at the event. Having a clear goal in mind will make networking less ambiguous and lead to more effective connections.                 </p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2">Have conversation starters ready to go. </h2>
                <p>
                  Broaching a big or small group can be intimidating but with the wright approach, you can join in on existing conversation or start your own successfully. Easy into the evening by introducing yourself to one person who is also flying solo and looking for someone to talk to. Read up on industry news and trend beforehand so you will be prepared to spark conversation and ask for their thought on the topics that are interesting to both of you. Whoever you approach first, relive some of the awkwardness with informed, relevant conversation. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2">When in doubt, ask a relevant question</h2>
                <p>
                  If the conversation starts to lull, shift the focus of the conversation to the person you are talking to by asking questions. You might think now, how I can make connections if we just talk about them whole time. And to that I would say, showing genuine interest in another person can say more about you than talking about yourself could. 
                 </p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2">If you want something, ask for it </h2>
                <p>
                  The highlight of networking events we all fantasize about is leaving with a concrete exchange that will move our business or career forward. If you haven’t asked to make of someone, go ahead and ask it. But make sure you frame it in a way that shows how it benefits them. 
                 </p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h2">Make a graceful exit and follow up</h2>
                <p>
                  The goal of networking isn’t to meet as many people as you can. It is to make valuable connections. When you do valuable connection, be sure to follow up afterwards. Following up with personal connection helps you differentiate and solidify the relationship.
